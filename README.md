# Next Weather App

`Live Demo:`
https://next-weather-app-lovat.vercel.app/

Users can see a 5 day weather forecast for `Winnipeg, MB`.

This project was developed using `NextJS` and deployed to `Vercel`.

API calls are made from the OpenWeatherMap API using the `Axios` library.
`Current Weather Data` && `5 Day / 3 Hour Forecast` were the routes I used from the API

Styling was done using Sass in correlation with NextJs' style modules.

Location is hard coded to `Winnipeg, MB` My home location.
